Warning: Licences of the Examples need to be clarified

Especially the contents of the musicxml subdirectory are concerning.
It would be highly desirable to ship a lot of examples, however, only
the Echigo-Jishi.xml contains a clear public domain license.
Many files carry a copyright mark, which in absence of a license
spec implies there are NO copyrights provided.
