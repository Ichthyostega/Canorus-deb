  * Convert to dpkg source format 3.0 (quilt) and remove quilt from
    Build-Depends
  * Build-Depend on libasound2-dev instead of libasound-dev
  * Convert clogosm.png again to 16x16 and 32x32 xpm images, something
    went wrong the first time

      upstream's canorus.desktop file
  * Install canorus.desktop file to provide a menu entry in KDE and
